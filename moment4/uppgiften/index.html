   <div class="hoatzin"> <h2>Hoatzin</h2>
    <p1> Native to the Amazon, hoatzin babies have tiny claws on their wings — as well as on their feet. Since their nests are in trees that frequently overhang water, it's a safety feature for when predators try to eat the babies. Baby hoatzins can simply hop down into the water, then climb back up the tree when it's safe, according to Audubon.
    The wing claws disappear as the birds mature — once they can fly, they no longer need them.</p1>

    <div class="crows"><h2>Crows</h2>
    <p2>According to National Geographic, crows can use tools and solve logic puzzles. Further, scientists believe that ravens may even pre-plan their tasks — a trait previously thought to be exclusively human.</p2> 
    </div>
    <div clas><h2>Bassian</h2>
        <p3>Picture this: You're hungry, and you need to go look for some food. Your favorite food is worms, and you know there are some in easy reach — but you can't see them because they're hiding. What do you do?
    If you're a Bassian thrush, you fart at them. According to Janey Levy's book "Really Strange Birds," these birds have adapted their foraging techniques to rely in part on generating enough gas to startle earthworms into moving. If the worms move, then the birds can find and eat them.</p3>

<div class="osprey_text">
    <p>Ospreys love to catch fresh fish — but they often want to transport their food somewhere closer to home before eating it. Their strong talons and the pads on their feet allow them to do this —  but picking up a big, slippery fish that might still be wriggling around can make flying difficult.
    According to Cornell Ornithology Lab's Birds of North America, ospreys specifically situate their fish in their grasp so that it is as aerodynamically streamlined as possible. A fish is held parallel to the osprey's body, head forward, so that it doesn't increase drag as the osprey flies toward home.</p>

<div class="hummingbird_text">
    <p>According to the National Park Service, hummingbird metabolisms are pretty intense across the over 330 species found in the Americas. Of course, if you were a hummingbird, you would also have a significantly shorter lifespan of just three to five years</p>
